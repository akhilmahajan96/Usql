//This lab shows the use of Wilcards
//Wildcards are used to read all the files in a folder
//Wildcards does not give you back the folder of the file names

//After running this job, a csv file "wildcard.csv" will be created under the "reporting" folder in your data lake store.
//If you run this job multiple times, it will over-write the existing file.

//Input Path
DECLARE @file_set_path string = "/staging/drivetime/{*}";
