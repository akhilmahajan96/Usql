We are analyzing data for a fictious restraunt chain called "TacoBoutIT". "TacoBoutIT" has 11 stores. 

All the stores except one is sending their drive thru timer data in their local time zones.

The "drive thru timer" data shows how long it takes for the restraunt to serve a customer from ordering the food via drive thru to getting the food. 

Today we will be analyzing drive thru timer data for lunch time. Lunch time is defined from 11 AM - 2 PM and the event code we are looking for is "LINE".

The stores are sending files in the format <StoreNumber>_<YYYYMMDD>_dttlog.txt.

We also have information regarding the "stores". 

We will be using drive thru timer and store data to do drive thru timer analysis.
