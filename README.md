We are analyzing data for a fictious restraunt chain called "TacoBoutIT". "TacoBoutIT" has stores all over US. 

All the stores send their drive thru timer data in their local time zones. The "drive thru timer" data shows how long it takes for the restraunt to serve a customer from ordering the food via drive thru to getting the food. The stores are sending the drive thru timer files in the format <StoreNumber>_<YYYYMMDD>_dttlog.txt.
  
We also have information regarding the "stores". 

Today we will be analyzing drive thru timer data for lunch time. Lunch time is defined from 11 AM - 2 PM and the event code we are looking for is "LINE ".

Please download the folder.

Please use "ADLA-USQL_Hands_On_Labs.docx" file to create Azure Data Lake Store and Azure Data Lake Analytics service. It also contains directions to create folders and upload the data which we would be analyzing. 

The data for the labs is stored in the "data" directory.
